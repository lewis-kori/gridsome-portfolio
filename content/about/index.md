Hi there!

This site is a place for me to showcase some of my projects. From small learning projects to some serious software engineering projects. It is also home to my personal blog where I write about my journey as a developer and whatever else that strikes my fancy. You can also check out all my blog posts on [dev](https://dev.to/lewiskori).

My passion revolves around the world of online businesses, with a special focus on fintech. I specialize in guiding non-technical founders and startups through the entire process of crafting exceptional online platforms. My expertise spans smart contract development within the Ethereum ecosystem, seamless payment processing, and integrations with major financial and payment service provider APIs, including Stripe, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and more.

Beyond the realm of computers, I find solace in the gym and the open road, pursuing fitness goals and gaining inspiration through my runs and hikes. My reading habit is an ever-present companion in my quest for knowledge.

Above all, what truly lights up my world is the act of creation. Whether it's lines of code or constructing tangible projects, I thrive on the joy of building.
