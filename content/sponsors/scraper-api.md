Scraper API is built for developers who need reliable, scalable web scraping without the headache of IP blocks or CAPTCHA walls. They handle IP rotation, CAPTCHA solving, and even headless browser emulation — so your scrapers look and behave like real users.

With over 20 million IPs, unlimited bandwidth, and built-in support for popular libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium, it works seamlessly across the Python ecosystem — and beyond. Whether you're using Node.js, Bash, PHP, or Ruby, integration is as simple as appending your target URL to their API endpoint.

If you're new to scraping, don’t worry — I’ve covered it extensively in [the webscraping series](/series/web-scraping-techniques-with-python/), and it's all free.

They’ve got a generous free plan — scale up only when you need to.
