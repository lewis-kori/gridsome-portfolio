Hi there!

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This site is where I showcase a curated selection of projects, from cutting-edge fintech platforms to scalable multitenant systems. It's also home to my personal blog, where I share insights into software engineering, startups, and life as a developer. You can find more of my writing on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/lewiskori), where I regularly share technical articles and developer tips.

I specialize in helping startups and non-technical founders transform ambitious ideas into functional, scalable online platforms. With deep experience in the fintech space, I craft solutions that integrate smart contracts, seamless payment processing, and APIs from providers like Stripe, Google Pay, and M-Pesa. Beyond fintech, I’m passionate about building robust systems that balance technical excellence with user-centric design.

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me in the gym or exploring the outdoors through runs and hikes. I'm also an avid reader, constantly seeking new perspectives and ideas to fuel both my work and personal growth.

At the heart of it all, I’m driven by a love for building. Whether it's elegant lines of code or transformative digital solutions. Let’s create something extraordinary together!

Here are a few technologies I've worked with:
