This package enables localization of web apps made with vue by use of google translate. As your website and app grows, you may find a need to expand to other markets outside your home country.

If your target market lives across the sea and speaks a different language, you may not have any choice but to localize. However, if those people can speak your language, consider other aspects (cultural and/or legal) to make an informed decision on whether to translate.

For more details on what localization is and the potential benefits, checkout this article.
