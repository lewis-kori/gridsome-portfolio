You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? You know 
what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

Just my luck, no ice. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
```

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Hello from './components/Hello';

const logo = require('./logo.svg');

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
      </div>
      <p className="App-intro">
        To get started, edit <code>src/App.tsx</code> and save to reload.
      </p>
      <Hello name="TypeScript" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

Just my luck, no ice. Life finds a way. Checkmate... You really think you can fly that thing? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists.

Checkmate... Just my luck, no ice. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Checkmate... Life finds a way. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
