Hi there!

This site is a place for me to showcase some of my projects. From small learning projects to some serious software engineering projects. It is also home to my personal blog where I write about my journey as a developer and whatever else that strikes my fancy. You can also check out all my blog posts on dev. My interests currently in the tech industry lie around backend web development, automation and I also dabble in web frontend.

In terms of non-computer hobbies I like working out at the gym and going on runs. I also read a lot. In general I found what makes me the happiest is building stuff. So I try and optimize for that.

So, have any cool projects youâ€™d like us to collaborate on? Like my blog posts? Want to say hi? Just drop me a message and i'll try to respond as soon as I can. You can also reach out to me on any of the social links within this site
