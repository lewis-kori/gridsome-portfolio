People talk a lot about big ideas, but the thing that actually changes outcomes is much smaller: showing up when you said you would. Whether it’s a 6 a.m. run or a product launch, execution is what earns trust and trust is what compounds.

A few months ago, I invested in a gym. One of my goals was to build a sense of community, so we started a Saturday morning running club. Six a.m., every week.

I’ve been a runner for years, but lately I’d been letting “too tired” and “too busy” win. The running club changed that. When you’ve promised people you’ll be there, you show up — even if your bed feels like it has diplomatic immunity. And when you do, you realise the showing up *is* the work. The enthusiasm fluctuates, sure, but that’s part of the game. Week by week, more people join. The momentum builds.

That same principle is at the core of my work as a software engineer. In tech, execution isn’t just about ticking boxes. It’s about delivering on what you said you would, because trust is currency. And when things don’t go to plan (which they won’t, often spectacularly), the next best thing to delivering is communicating early. Silence erodes trust faster than failure.

In both running and work, follow-through compounds. Each time you do what you said you’d do — or own up when you can’t — you build a reputation that opens doors. That reputation doesn’t come from big heroic sprints. It comes from the quiet, boring, unglamorous act of showing up.

The Saturday club has reclaimed my weekends. It’s also reminded me that whether you’re trying to run five kilometres or ship a feature, success multiplies when you close the gap between what you promise and what you deliver.
