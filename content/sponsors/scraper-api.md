Scraper API is a startup specializing in strategies that'll ease the worry of your IP address from being blocked while web scraping.They utilize IP rotation so you can avoid detection. Boasting over 20 million IP addresses and unlimited bandwidth.

In addition to this, they provide CAPTCHA handling for you as well as enabling a headless browser so that you'll appear to be a real user and not get detected as a web scraper.
Usage is not limited to scrapy but works with requests, BeautifulSoup and selenium in the python ecosystem. Integration with other popular platforms such as node.js, bash, PHP and ruby is also supported. All you have to do is concatenate your target URL with their API endpoint on the HTTP get request then proceed as you normally would on any web scraper. Don't know how to webscrape? Don't worry, I've covered that topic extensively on [the webscraping series](/series/web-scraping-techniques-with-python/). All entirely free!
